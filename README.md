## Hey there! 👋

Welcome to my slice of the digital universe. I'm navigating the complexities of Software Engineering at Chalmers, where my life oscillates between awe-inspiring eureka moments and existential debugging crises. Here's the lowdown:

- 🎓 Engrossed in Chalmers' world, where I toggle between software theories and the actual code that runs the world.
- 🤖 Dabbling in machine learning and data mining, because teaching machines to learn is the closest I've gotten to having a superpower.
- 🛠️ Expanding my toolkit beyond Python to embrace the full spectrum of tech, from frontend razzle-dazzle to backend wizardry.

## On the Horizon 🌅

- I'm all about turning ideas into executable code that sometimes does what I actually intended.
- Frontend, backend, and everything in between – I'm on it, learning, breaking, and occasionally fixing things.
- Goals? Revolutionize how we interact with tech, make a few mistakes along the way, and keep the passion for innovation burning.
